// TYPE METHODS
// Instance methods, as described above, are methods that you call on an instance of a particular type. You can also define methods that are called on the type itself. These are called type methods.
// You indicate a type method with the static keyword before the methods func keyword.

// classes can use the class keyword instead, to allow subclasses to override the superclass's implementation of the mathod

// EXPLANATION OF STATIC AND TYPE METHODS, INSTANCE TYPE AND WHEN TO USE IT.

/*
 3. Memory Implications
 
 Property Type ||  Memory Allocation              ||  Lifetime
 --------------   -------------------------------   -----------
 Instance      || Each instance gets its own copy || Exists as long as the instance exists.
 Static        || Single copy in global memory    || Exists for the entire app runtime.
 
 4. When to Use static vs. Instance Properties
 
 Use Case           ||  Example                                                  || Choice
 -------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------  --------
 Shared state       ||  Highest unlocked level (all players see the same value). || static
 Per-instance state ||  Current level (each player has their own progress).      || Instance property
 
 
 5. Analogy: Bulletin Board vs. Personal Notebook

     'static' Property: Like a bulletin board in a school.

        > Anyone can read/write to it (LevelTracker.highestLevelUnlocked).

        > Changes are visible to everyone.

     'Instance Property': Like a personal notebook (currentLevel).

        > Each student (instance) has their own notebook.

        > Changing one doesnâ€™t affect others.
 
 By separating shared (static) and instance-specific state, your LevelTracker elegantly handles both global progression rules and individual player progress.
